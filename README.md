SketchTune: Feel your Creations

Artists often express their feelings through their craft. Using music to amplify the emotions that fuel their art allows artists to fully immerse into their creations.

What it does
SketchTune is an innovative application that curates a personalized music playlist in real time as an artist draws or sketches. While the artist's strokes come to life on a digital canvas, the application analyzes various characteristics of their artwork—such as texture, color blending, cultural elements, and form—to select and adjust a dynamic playlist that enhances their creative flow and matches their mood. This combination of art and music creates an immersive experience, merging auditory and visual stimuli to inspire and boost creativity.
